### Link To Pull Request

https://github.com/joannakl/cs480_s18/pull/59

To fix this issue I first forked the repository onto my own GitHub account. I cloned that repository to my local computer. I then edited the post found in _inclides/daily/04.markdown. I edited the spelling of Cathedral. I then added the file with "git add .". I then commited it with "git commit -m "Fixed Cathedral" and then I pushed to gh-pages branch. "git push origin gh-pages".

I then went to the original repository and made a pull request from my local repostiry.Specifically, I compared forks.

I am interested in the Brackets project. I currently recieve one issue per day. This project works in JavaScript, CSS and HTML. Languages I feel comfortable working in.
I also signed up for youtube-dl, a program used to download youtube videos from the commandline. A project that I would actually love to use myself.

I also am interested in the matplotlib project and it works in python and I am excited to work in python.
