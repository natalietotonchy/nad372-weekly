I emailed the picture to Joanna. I attended the BUGS NYU Event. The event consisted of 3 pannelists and they discussed the importance of open data. I was interested to learn about the different projects students are taking part in. There was one project that tracked the response time of fire ambulances in New York City.
### My Contributions This Week
I made two new contirbution to Wikipedia and provided citation for a piece of information on 22nd of March 2018. 
The next contribution I made was adding a source to the fact that HBC outlived its rivals. Both can be found in this url.
