### Reflection on Invited Talk
I thought the talk was interesting. I appreciated the honesty in that Google does keep some algorithms proprietary like self driving cars, searching, etc. I am interested in Bazel and what it has the potential to do. I also appreciate Google's view that things are better the Open Source way. I think it's cool that the software used for building is open source so that a lot of people praciticing software development are on the same wavelength with the same technology. 

### Project Progress
We have been trying to trace the difference between a successful and unsuccessful change for a week. It is a lot harder than we anticipated because it is a backend issue. I tried to follow the direction Tom gave about adding the new users to the stream and I added some code to the actions.py file but it did not work.  
My specific task is to try and modify the python file so that it accepts the current user in the ums array.
