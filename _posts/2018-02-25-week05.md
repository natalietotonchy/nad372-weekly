### What type of things are you looking for when you select and open source project to work on?

I look at how big the project is and the languages it is using. I would like to work on projects whose languages I am familiar with. 
I look at when the last pull request or issue was made and when it was merged. If an issue never got a response or pull requests don't seem to be merged, it indicates that the project isn't very active. I look at the number of contributors.I look for labels on issues. I also evaluate how friendly people are in issues, discussion forum and chat. 

### What are you able to offer the team that you will be working on for the prokect?

### What are you hoping to learn from working on an open source project?
I am hoping to learn how to find issues within my scope faster, and look throughprojects faster to see what is within my reach.

### What are you most worried about when you are thinking about and planning to work on an open source project?

I am worried I will spend a lot of time learning about a project, only to learn that I cannot contribute and will have to choose another project.
