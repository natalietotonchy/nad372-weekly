### First Contribution
I made two contributions on Wikipedia. I editted a page of my favorite show One Tree Hill and I added more information on how season two ended in respect to one of the main characters. I selected this article because I am knowledgable about this show and thought the quote at the end was valuable.

### Second Contribution
I also added a reference to one of the pages that needed a reference for Steve McQueen. I searched for ways to contribute to wikipedia and there were missing references for a large array of articles and one of the ways to help was to find references for data. I found a reference and then linked it to the article on Wikipedia.
