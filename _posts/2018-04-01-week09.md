### Contributions this week
My team is working on Zulip and while we were looking at closed issues, I found a problem to the user's fix. They hard-coded the values of the dimensions of the textbox when it should be dynamic. I made an issue documenting the problem, listing the source file and the fix.

I also commented on an issue on Zulip asking for the relevant source files and source code.
