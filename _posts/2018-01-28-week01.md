### Open Source
Open Source is a movement that encourages developers to work together to create impactful code that can be used tobenefit society. I think its important to foster community-based initiatives because we produce our best work when we combine our individual strengths. 

### Open Source Projects
### 1
I use Wikipedia quite often while writing papers or getting a general understanding of a particular topic. I think it constitutes as Open Source, because although it is not code based, it is a hub of free and open information.

### 2
I use Raspberry Pis often to create small, short term projects. Raspberry Pis have software that is open source. The raspberry Pi is open hardware, and many projects done with it are free and available. I once made a camera using the raspberry pi and wrote a python script to take photos. 

### 3
When I write Java I used Eclipse as my IDE and it is an open source project. An alternative I use is Sublime however it is not open source. 
### 4
I use Firefox as my web browser and it is open source. I have not contributed to its code though. 
###Questions
### 1
How do Open Source based companies make their money?

### 2 

How is Red Hat's open source code avaiable?
