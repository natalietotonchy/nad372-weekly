### Strengths and Weaknesses 

I personally do not know JavaScript and a significant amount of Zulip requires Javascript knowledge. 
However, my teammates Adnan and Emilio know Javascript.

We all know python and that is a huge strength. 

The project is relatively large so it will be really difficult getitng familiar with the code base.


We are planning to meet on Wednesday at 5:00pm


### Milestones
1. Finding an issue.
2. Installing the source code.
3. Reading and Understanding the issue.
4. Solving the issue.
4. Submitting a pull request.
