The Cathedral view of programming, in my opinion, means that a close-knit group of developers work together to produce a specific product under one company or organization. As the author mentions, it is woeking in "splendid isolation, with no beta to be released before its time." The final, optimal version is released; it is not a work in progress. The Bazaar approach is different and is comprimised by stray developers. It comes together with different approaches and styles to try and complete the overall goal. 

I prefer the Bazaar method, even though it is more unconventional. It seems like there is more room to experiment without facing major consequences. It also feels welcoming to amateur developers.
