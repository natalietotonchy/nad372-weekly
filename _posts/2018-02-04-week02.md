The Cathedral view of programming, in my opinion, means that a close-knit group of developers work together to produce a specific product under one company or organization. As the author mentions, it is woeking in "splendid isolation, with no beta to be released before its time." The final, optimal version is released; it is not a work in progress. The Bazaar approach is different and is comprimised by stray developers. It comes together with different approaches and styles to try and complete the overall goal. 

I prefer the Bazaar method, even though it is more unconventional. It seems like there is more room to experiment without facing major consequences. It also feels welcoming to amateur developers.  

Among the 19 lessons the two I find most interesting are:

Lesson 2: . Good programmers know what to write. Great ones know what to rewrite (and reuse).

I think this is usually undervalued. Good programmers can decipher code that is efficient and impactful. And more importantly, good programmers can work with already existing code, which is often a challenge. It takes a specific skill set to tailor and modify code that is not yours and make it better. 

Lesson 7: Release early. Release often. And listen to your customers.

I think the best way to get feedback on code is to deal with reported bugs. The more often you release code, the more bugs that will be explored and reported and this works towards making your product better.
